# surfs_up


Overview:

Within this module, we were exposed to SQLite and SQLAlchemy and was able to utilize these tools to extract data and generate them as Pandas data frames. We also learned how to set up Flask and see how APIs were generated in a similar sense. This project also allowed for us to connect a database to flask and see how the all of these tools interact with one another. 


Results:

Within the data extracted, it is clear that June had overall higher numbers compared to December, but not by a large margin. Furthermore, the precipitation values were even closer to one another, with December having slightly larger numbers instead. June also had more values to work with, and that may have led to results being more precise than the data extracted from December. However, the numbers do not have a large enough difference to have a drastic statistical impact within the data.


Summary:

Overall, it was to be expected that June had higher temperatures than December, as December is closer to winter. Because of the geographical location of Hawaii, the numbers stayed rather consistent throughout the year, and there was never a large difference within temperature, even with these 2 months. Other queries that could have been created would be a query about precipitation, and it could be seen that December had larger numbers than June in this case. Because the overall data did not have a lot of information, other hypothetical queries that could be made could concern aspects of the weather such as: humidity, wind speed, air pressure, etc.
